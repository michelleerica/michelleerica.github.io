  <h3>Debrief</h3>

    The game might seem super basic on the surface (and even more basic under the hood) but I learnt so much from the project. From a purely technical perspective, I learnt about separation of concerns and how to use jQuery to manipulate the DOM. But more importantly, I learnt about myself. I learnt to be patient with myself and that I work better when I map out what I want to achieve before jumping in. Additionally, as a learning tool, I would document how I solved the problem I had faced for future reference.

      <h3>The idea</h3>
    <p>I like food. I also like instagram but my instagram is cluttered with to many ballerinas, calligraphers and travel photos to make it a useful food finding mechanism.
<br>
I wanted to make a pure food photo sharing app. One where users could post photos of their meals and sort on dishes, venues and cuisines for maximum flexibility </p>

        As my first full-stack app, I’m subjectively pleased with the results, but I know it’s not much to look at.
        <br>
        From the project I learnt a lot about the MVC (model views controllers) framework, particularly how to store data and the need for models to handle data in a meaningful way.      </p>

Location-based Q&A web application whereby users can ask other users location specific questions. The app is aimed at connecting the curious with the knowledgeable within a particular geographical area, with language translating available for non-english speakers. </p>

        Fraga was a great opportunity to work as part of a team with developers with different strengths and skills to my own. As a result, I gained a lot of insight into how other people work and think through problems, and how to deal with merge conflicts in git!

Throughout the project, the team kept track of tasks and progress using Trello and daily stand ups to make sure we were across what each other was doing, and were all working towards a common goal.

I’m really proud of what we accomplished in a week. It was great to work with other developers who were equally passionate about the project and everyone was keen to put their hand up for different tasks.

    <p>Bullet Journal wireframing project, which allows those new to bullet journalling to get inspired by other bullet journallers and wireframe their templates before committing it to paper. The purpose of the site is to use tech to take the frustration out of analog bullet journalling.

        The project allowed me to combine my love of brush lettering and aesthetics with tech to solve a problem. It gave me the opportunity to solidify my working knowledge of not only front and back-end web development, but also the interplay between the two.
